# 🧠 Personal Coding Platform

This project is a full-stack coding practice platform designed to help users improve their problem-solving skills in a structured and personalized way.

## 🖥️ Frontend

The frontend interface was generated using **Replit** and offers a clean, interactive experience for users to:

- Browse coding problems by difficulty or tags
- Track their progress
- View roadmaps and follow learning paths
- Save and review their personal solutions

## 🚀 Backend

The backend was built entirely by me using **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Alembic** for migrations. It includes a well-structured REST API to manage:

- Users, authentication, and admin roles
- Coding problems with tagging and metadata
- Roadmaps that guide users through topics
- User-specific saved solutions
- Commenting system
- Problem tracking (favorites and done)

The backend is optimized for clean architecture, maintainability, and scalable integration with modern frontend tools.

## 💡 About the Project

This platform is inspired by educational platforms like LeetCode and NeetCode, but adds more flexibility for learning paths, personal code saving, and comment-based discussions.

It is designed to be extensible — new features like code execution, leaderboards, or AI feedback can be integrated with minimal changes.
